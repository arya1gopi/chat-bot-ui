# Job Search Chatbot UI Documentation

## Overview
This React component provides a simple interface for interacting with an AI-powered job search chatbot. Users can input their queries, and the chatbot responds with job listings or relevant information. It utilizes the Flask-based API for processing job-related queries.

## Features
- **User Input Handling**: Allows users to type queries related to job searches.
- **API Integration**: Sends user queries to the backend API (`http://127.0.0.1:5000/get_job_response`).
- **Dynamic Message Display**: Displays messages from both the user and the bot.
- **Job Listing Formatting**: Displays job details in a structured format with links.
- **Loading State**: Shows a typing indicator while waiting for the bot's response.

## Installation and Setup
Ensure you have Node.js installed, then install dependencies:

```bash
npm install axios react
```

## Component Breakdown

### `useState` Hooks
- `userInput`: Stores the user's query input.
- `messages`: Stores conversation messages.
- `loading`: Indicates when the bot is processing a request.

### `sendMessage` Function
- **Clears previous messages** before sending a new request.
- **Validates input** to ensure it's not empty.
- **Sends a request** to the chatbot API.
- **Handles API response** by displaying job listings or error messages.
- **Handles errors gracefully** if the API request fails.

### UI Structure
